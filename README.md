# Otter

Developed under the [ExCALIBUR task parallelism cross-cutting research theme](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/exposing-parallelism-task-parallelism/), Otter is a tool designed to facilitate data-driven parallelisation of serial code. Otter allows HPC developers to:

- Annotate, trace & visualise loop/task-based serial code as a directed graph;
- Recommend strategies for transforming serial code into effective task-based parallel code;
- Non-invasively trace & visualise loop/task-based OpenMP 5.x programs.

The [project documentation](https://otter-taskification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) describes the Otter toolset and explains how to use the features above.
