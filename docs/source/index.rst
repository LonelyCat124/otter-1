Otter Documentation
===================

Developed under the `ExCALIBUR task parallelism cross-cutting research
theme <https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/exposing-parallelism-task-parallelism/>`__,
Otter is a tool designed to facilitate data-driven parallelisation of
serial code. Otter allows HPC developers to:

-  Annotate, trace & visualise loop/task-based serial code as a directed
   graph;
-  Recommend strategies for transforming serial code into effective
   task-based parallel code;
-  Non-invasively trace & visualise loop/task-based OpenMP 5.x programs.

Check out the :doc:`installation </source/pages/installation>` page for instructions on installing Otter.

Otter Toolset
-------------

The Otter toolset includes:

-  :doc:`Otter task-graph </source/pages/otter-task-graph>`: an API and runtime library
   for annotating & tracing the task-graph of a (possibly parallel)
   target application.
-  :doc:`Otter OMPT </source/pages/otter-ompt>`: an OMPT plugin for non-invasive tracing of
   the loop/task-based structure of OpenMP 5.x programs.
-  :doc:`PyOtter </source/pages/pyotter>`: The visualisation & reporting tool for use
   with Otter trace data.
